                <p>An impromptu team was formed and were given 48 hours to develop a product that addresses a universal problem solely based 
                    on the theme “outside the box”. The solution needed to easy to obtain while offering an unconventional approach to a 
                    common problem: improving healthy communication within families.</p>

                    <p>Our group brainstormed outside-the-box ideas and ultimately created a new, innovative way to communicate with families.</p>

                    <h3>Everything Starts at Home</h3>
                    <p>So we realized that communication at home also translates to communication in public spaces, and our prototype was developed with this in mind.</p>

                    <h3>Main Point</h3>
                    <p>We solved the challenge of collaborating with unfamiliar team members by using listening, empathy, and communication to unite our strengths and effectively work together.</p>

                    <li>We brainstormed solutions for family communication and ultimately decided to create an engaging card game.</li>
                    <li>We interviewed five families at Liberty Station about communication and how parents listen during problem-solving.</li>
                    <li>I facilitated turning ideas into simplified card wireframes, forming the foundation and rules for our game.</li>
