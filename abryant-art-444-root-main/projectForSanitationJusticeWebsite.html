                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>Version 1 of the Project for Sanitation Justice was difficult for non-profits and the general
                   public to navigate due to the enormous amount of information on the website, and had no clear 
                   strategy for communicating research to the general audience. Additionally, a lack of scalability 
                   in the web design severely impacted the ability to rapidly provide up-to-date information. 
                   A new website was needed that focused on the most important aspects of the project without 
                   overwhelming the end user.</p>

            <!-- Process-->
            <section class="containerStyles">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Interviewed end users and stakeholders on their goals and pain points.</li>
                  <li>Applied research to content strategy which would inform the website's design.</li>
                  <li>Aggregate presented information into more generalized webpages which funnel users toward more specialized topics.</li>
                  <li>Created wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes on Figma and tested basic functionality</li>
                  <li>Created high-fidelity prototype on Figma and altered styles for accessibility</li>
                  <li>Transferred high-fidelity prototype design to Wordpress website</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Outcome-->
            <section class="containerStyles">
                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>The website was launched in Q1 2024 with a 49% increase in new user traffic, with a total of 1,546 users, 
                  and a 120% increase in page views, with the majority of the traffic focused on the organization's work (743 views), 
                  and the contact page (338 users).</p>

                <h2>User Research was foundational to strategic design</h2>
                <p>We interviewed three types of users who are the most actively searching for the information provided by the Project for 
                  Sanitation Justice: students, researchers, concerned citizen-activists, and non-profit organizations. <br><br>
                  Through our research, we identified several needs which would inform the design of v.2 of our website:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Students and researchers needed to find information more quickly and easily.</li>
                  <li>Non-profits and citizen-activists required simple language paired with visibility of mass media presence to generate public engagement.</li>

                    <h3>Let The Website Point the Way</h3>
                    <p>The website should not assume the role of providing information best left to the publication. It needs to tell the user where the information can be found.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="containerStyles">
                    <h3>Simplicity = Transparency</h3>
                    <p>The easier information is found and understood by the general audience the greater likelihood it will be acted upon.</p>

                    <h3>Build on Overlaping Goals</h3>
                    <p>Ease of navigation was the cross-demographic goal that serves as the foundation that would inform the development of the new website.</p>

            <!--Problem Solving-->
            <section class="containerStyles">
                <h2>Building from the simple, up</h2>
                <p>The common pain-point across all interviewed demographics was complex navigation, so I began developing the website with this problem in mind.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I distilled the homepage navigation into three points: "Who We Are" , "What We Do", and "Why We Do It" with one-sentence pitches. This builds 
                    interest to where the end user will easily navigate to the appropriate webpage.</li>
                  <li>Created illustrations of the Project for Sanitation Justice's team to create a down-to-earth connection between researcher and the general public 
                    and add visual interest.</li>
                  <li>Created accessible color scheme and typeface style guides which keeps users with disabilities at the forefront of every design decision made.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="containerStyles">
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>We interviewed three types of users who are the most actively searching for the information provided by the Project for Sanitation Justice: students, researchers, 
                  concerned citizen-activists, and non-profit organizations.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increased Engagement:</strong> New and existing users are more easily able to navigate the website and find sought-after information quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalable Design:</strong> New templates were made that allow the organization quickly integrate new hires with minimal difficulty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong Foundation for Growth:</strong>The Project for Sanitation Justice's website provides ready-to-access materials which aids the recent expansion to Eugene, Oregon.</li>
