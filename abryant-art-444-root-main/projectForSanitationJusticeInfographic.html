                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The Project for Sanitation Justice had a lack of outreach which concisely communicates the pressing 
                    need of public restrooms to the general public in an engaging way.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Process-->
            <section class="containerStyles">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The core message was formed through the needs of advocates and nonprofits.</li>
                        <li>Preexisting research conducted by the Project for Sanitation Justice team was analyzed to fit the intended message for public health advocacy.</li>
                        <li>Elements were created in Adobe Illustrator.</li>
                        <li>Repeated critiques and iterations refined the infographic.</li>
                        <li>Final deliverables were presented.</li>

            <!-- Outcome-->
            <section class="containerStyles">
                <h2>Analyzing Gaps in Outreach</h2>
                <p>Our research was presented often at city council meetings which were met with reservation from decisionmakers.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Specialist knowledge with an academic approach makes it difficult to see where information can matriculate into political affairs.</li>
                        <li>Advanced knowledge in public health was required for our community advocates to communicate demands to city council.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Identifiable information needed to be sanitized for HIPAA compliance.</li>
                    <li>By creating personas which informed our points we identified key overlaps that would be used to inform important points.</li>

                        <li>The organization is able to rapidly communicate to targeted demographics. </li>
                        <li>Information is now more easily digested by adopters and policymakers for easier and quicker decisionmaking.</li>
