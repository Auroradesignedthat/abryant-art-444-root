                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>California has mandated that no human-sourced debris will be discharged into California state waterways through storm drain systems.
                     A research project backed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was launched to assess the likelihood of
                      success of the California Trash Amendment Mandate established by Senate Bill 1383.</p>

            <section class="containerStyles">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aggregate transcripts stored by previous research from the Project for Sanitation Justice</li>
                        <li>Develop new codes which identifies data within the transcripts relevant to the project</li>
                        <li>Read and listen to transcripts while coding important data points.</li>
                    </ul>

            <!-- Outcome-->
            <section class="containerStyles">
                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>19 transcripts were analyzed and coded which guided a statewide report on best practices on providing Water,
                     Sanitation, and Hygeive (WaSH) services to underserved Californians.</p>

            <section class="containerStyles">
                <h2>Challenge Goes Here</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Forming relevant codes which meets the criteria of the project was difficult because of the complex relationship between shelterless individuals and city/state policy.</li>
                        <li>Coding excerpts required learning about the nature of human-sourced debris within complex weather and human systems.</li>

                    <h3>Added Nuance</h3>
                    <p>Discoveries were made regarding official city policy and its impact regarding the handling of human sourced debris from shelterless encampment clearings.</p>

                <div class="containerStyles">
                    <h3>Solved Problem</h3>
                    <p>Human-sourced debris seldom remain in a single spot due to the geography and the local weather systems of San Diego, compounding the problem of waterway pollution.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The study was not acted upon by the state of California.</li>
                        <li>Future steps include placing the study on the Project for Sanitation Justice website for public view.</li>
                        <li>The document will be used as a foundation for grassroot efforts to provide sanitation and dignity to everyone.</li>
