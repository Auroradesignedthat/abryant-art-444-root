                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The WaSH Student Exhibit at San Diego State University is focused on transferring a physical exhibit showcasing student
                     research about campus sanitation issues onto a website, requiring careful coordination to collect and present student 
                     photos with associated captions and narratives online. In addition to adopting file naming conventions and instructional
                     design for successful uploads using Squoosh.app to optimize digital photos, the project also navigates the political
                     challenge of ensuring that digital presentation of the research highlighted shared responsibility for sanitation
                     without being misconstrued as criticism of the custodial staff, whose work and perspectives were included through
                     collaborative discussions.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The initial plan was to create a webpage that mirrored the Donor Hall exhibit, which featured exceptional student work.</li>
                        <li>The process involved using Squoosh.app to optimize photos, documenting each step with annotated visuals and flow diagrams,
                             establishing clear file naming conventions to pair captions with photos.</li>
                        <li>Create a Google Slide with instructions on how to optimize photos using Squoosh.app and distribute it to the professors so 
                            they could then share it with their respective classes.</li>

                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>Most students in both the public health and criminal justice classes followed instructions for submitting assets, but incomplete
                    submissions-such as missing photos or captions-highlighted inconsistencies and the need for further clarity, prompting development
                    of a new webpage template to ensure a cohesive presentation. Additionally, the physical exhibit remains, now with clarified messaging
                    that avoids blaming custodial staff and instead highlights administrative issues, supported by a new communication strategy that
                    spotlights the appropriate parties.</p>
